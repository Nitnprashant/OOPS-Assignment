    "Q 1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: This concept binds together the data and the methods that operate on that data, and keeps them safe from outside interference and misuse. In other words, it hides the implementation details of an object from the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: This concept shows only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the internal details. It helps to reduce complexity and increase reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: This concept allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The child class can also add new properties and behavior or override the ones inherited from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: This concept allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides a way to write code that can work with different types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Composition: This concept allows an object to be made up of other objects or collections of objects. It provides a way to create complex objects from simpler ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "These five concepts are the foundation of OOP and are used to create robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems."

    "Q 4. How does Python implement method overloading? Give an example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Python does not support method overloading in the classical sense, unlike languages like C++ or Java. However, you can achieve similar behavior using optional arguments and variable argument lists. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Calculator:\n",
    "    def add(self, *args):\n",
    "        return sum(args)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the Calculator class\n",
    "calc = Calculator()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call the add method with different number of arguments\n",
    "print(calc.add(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n",
    "print(calc.add(2, 3, 4, 5))  # Output: 14\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the add method can take any number of arguments, and the *args syntax allows it to accept a variable number of arguments. This way, you can achieve a similar behavior to method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use the @functools.singledispatch decorator to implement function overloading based on the type of the first argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from functools import singledispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "@singledispatch\n",
    "def fun(arg):\n",
    "    return \"default\"\n",
    "\n",
    "@fun.register\n",
    "def _(arg: int):\n",
    "    return \"int\"\n",
    "\n",
    "@fun.register\n",
    "def _(arg: str):\n",
    "    return \"str\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(fun(1))  # Output: int\n",
    "print(fun(\"hello\"))  # Output: str\n",
    "print(fun(1.5))  # Output: default\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the fun function is overloaded based on the type of the first argument. The @singledispatch decorator defines the default behavior, and the @fun.register decorators specify the behavior for specific types."

    "Q 5. What are the three types of access modifiers in Python? How are they denoted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Python has three types of access modifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Public: No underscore prefix, accessible from anywhere.\n",
    "2. Protected: Single underscore prefix (_), intended to be accessible only within the class and its subclasses.\n",
    "3. Private: Double underscore prefix (__), name mangling occurs, making it harder to access from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Python's access modifiers are not strictly enforced, but rather serve as a convention to indicate the intended usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    public_var = \"public\"\n",
    "    _protected_var = \"protected\"\n",
    "    __private_var = \"private\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def public_method(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _protected_method(self):\n",

    "    def __private_method(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",

    "Q 7. What is the Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python? How can you retrieve it programmatically?\n",

    "Q 13. Explain the concept of the Diamond Problem in multiple inheritance. How does Python resolve it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The Diamond Problem is a classic issue in multiple inheritance, where a class inherits conflicting attributes or methods from its parent classes. This happens when two classes, let's say Class A and Class B, inherit from a common base class, Class C, and then another class, Class D, inherits from both Class A and Class B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class C:\n",
    "    def method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Class C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class A(C):\n",
    "    def method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Class A\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class B(C):\n",
    "    def method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Class B\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class D(A, B):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "d = D()\n",
    "d.method()  # Which method should be called?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Class D inherits from both Class A and Class B, which both override the method() from Class C. This creates a conflict because Class D can't decide which method to call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python resolves this issue using a technique called \"Method Resolution Order\" (MRO). MRO is a linear ordering of all the parent classes, which Python uses to resolve conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 3.0 and later, the MRO is computed using the \"C3 linearization\" algorithm. This algorithm ensures that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The local class (the class being defined) is always first\n",
    "- The parents are ordered from left to right\n",
    "- If a parent appears in multiple inheritance graphs, it's only considered once\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this algorithm, Python resolves the Diamond Problem by calling the method from the first parent class in the MRO. In our example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class D(A, B):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "print(D.__mro__)  # Output: (__main__.D, __main__.A, __main__.B, __main__.C, object)\n",
    "\n",
    "The MRO for Class D is D -> A -> B -> C -> object. Therefore, when we call d.method(), Python will call the method from Class A, which is the first parent class in the MRO.\n",
    "\n",
    "This resolution ensures that the Diamond Problem is avoided, and Python can handle multiple inheritance with ease."

    "Q 14. Write a class method that keeps track of the number of instances created from a class.\n",

    "Ans. Here is an example of a class method that keeps track of the number of instances created from a class:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Print the instance count\n",
    "print(InstanceTracker.get_instance_count())  # Output: 3\n",

The __init__ method increments this count every time a new instance is created. The get_instance_count class method returns the current instance count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the _instance_count attribute is prefixed with a single underscore, which is a convention in Python indicating that it's intended to be private. This means it should not be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the get_instance_count method is a class method, which means it's bound to the class itself, rather than any particular instance. This allows you to call it on the class directly, rather than on an instance."
